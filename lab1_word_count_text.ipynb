    "\n",
    "In Spark, we first create a base [DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/index.html#DataFrame=org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[org.apache.spark.sql.Row]). We can then apply one or more transformations to that base DataFrame. *A DataFrame is immutable, so once it is created, it cannot be changed.* As a result, each transformation creates a new DataFrame. Finally, we can apply one or more actions to the DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that Spark uses lazy evaluation, so transformations are not actually executed until an action occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform several exercises to obtain a better understanding of DataFrames:\n",
    "* Create a collection of 10,000 people \n",
    "* Create a Spark DataFrame from that collection\n",
    "* Subtract one from each value using `map`\n",
    "* Perform action `collect` to view results\n",
    "* Perform action `count` to view counts\n",
    "* Apply transformation `filter` and view results with `collect`\n",
    "* Learn about lambda functions\n",
    "* Explore how lazy evaluation works and the debugging challenges that it introduces\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame consists of a series of `Row` objects; each `Row` object has a set of named columns. You can think of a DataFrame as modeling a table, though the data source being processed does not have to be a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a DataFrame must have a _schema_, which means it must consist of columns, each of which has a _name_ and a _type_. Some data sources have schemas built into them. Examples include RDBMS databases, Parquet files, and NoSQL databases like Cassandra. Other data sources don't have computer-readable schemas, but you can often apply a schema programmatically."

    "\n",
    "So far, we've created a distributed DataFrame that is splitted into many partitions, where each partition is stored on a single machine in our cluster.  Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common DataFrame operations is `select()`, and it works more or less like a SQL `SELECT` statement: You can select specific columns from the DataFrame, and you can even use `select()` to create _new_ columns with values that are derived from existing column values. We can use `select()` to create a new column that decrements the value of the existing `age` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "`select()` is a _transformation_. It returns a new DataFrame that captures both the previous DataFrame and the operation to add to the query (`select`, in this case). But it does *not* actually execute anything on the cluster. When transforming DataFrames, we are building up a _query plan_. That query plan will be optimized, implemented (in terms of RDDs), and executed by Spark _only_ when we call an action (see Lazy Evaluation process)."
